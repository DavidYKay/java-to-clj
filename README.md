# java-to-clj

This is a basic Java -> Clojure source code converter.

Note! Some aspects of Java are not yet supported!

See the "TODO" list for parts of the Java language that aren't implemented yet.

Please file a ticket if you'd like me to hurry up and implement one of the below language features.

## Usage

* `lein ring server`
* Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Paste your Java code into the left pane

* You now have Clojure code in the right pane.

## TODO

* Increment
* For
* ForEach with Lambda

* continue
* do
* Super
* Method Reference
* Deploy to Heroku/similar
